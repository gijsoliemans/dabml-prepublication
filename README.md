## Overview
Startups adopting generative AI face challenges not captured by traditional enterprise frameworks.  
The **daBML framework** extends the well-known **Build-Measure-Learn (BML)** cycle with two upstream phases:

1. **Define** â€“ clarify goals, scope, KPIs, and innovation type.  
2. **Analyse** â€“ identify risks (technical, ethical, legal) before experimenting.  
3. **Build** â€“ develop a Minimum Viable Implementation (MVI).  
4. **Measure** â€“ track KPIs and gather feedback.  
5. **Learn** â€“ reflect, iterate, or pivot.

This approach provides startups with a lightweight toolset for **intentional, risk-aware, and iterative adoption** of generative AI.
